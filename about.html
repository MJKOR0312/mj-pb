                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>We live in an era of abundance, yet we suffer from "Analysis Paralysis." With thousands of restaurant options and delivery apps at our fingertips, choosing a simple lunch menu has become a stressful task that drains our mental energy.</p>
                <p><strong>MenuGenie's mission is simple:</strong> Eliminate decision fatigue and bring the joy of discovery back to your dining table. We aim to help modern people save time and explore global cuisines with a single click.</p>

                <h2>How We Are Different</h2>
                <p>Unlike simple random number generators, MenuGenie is built with a <strong>Culturally Aware Algorithm</strong>. We understand that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A "Light Lunch" in Korea (e.g., Gimbap) is different from a lunch in the US (e.g., Sandwich).</li>
                    <li>Dinner is often a social event requiring different menu types like BBQ or Hot Pot.</li>
                    <li>Food pairs better with the right drink or side dish.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our database is meticulously curated to reflect these nuances across 15+ countries.</p>

                <h2>The Team</h2>
                <p>MenuGenie started as a small project by a developer who was tired of spending 30 minutes every day debating lunch options with colleagues. Today, it serves thousands of users globally, helping them make faster, tastier decisions.</p>
